# Snake

This is a group of JavaScript files that simulates a game of [Snake](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)>).
The single player game consists of a line moving around a board while trying to get as many tokens as possible, each
allowing the line to grow. The game ends if the line hits itself or runs into the edge of the board at any point.
