# Snake

This is a group of JavaScript files that simulates a game of [Snake](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)>).
The single player game consists of a snake (represented as a line) moving around a board while trying to get as many tokens as
possible, each allowing the snake to grow. The game ends if the snake hits itself or runs into the edge of the board at any
point.

## Getting Started

In order to play, visit this website: <https://japonte21.github.io/snake-game/>. The game supports movement using both the
arrow keys, as well as the WASD keys. A sound is played each time the snake moves direction, collects a token, or when the game
ends. Along with that, each time a token is picked up, the game speeds ups.

If you would like to have a copy of the project to make your own desired edits:

- Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/japonte21/snake-game.git`
- Edit it in the IDE of your choice that supports JavaScript
- In order to run it locally, use a [localhost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localhost) on the browser of your choice

This will allow you to have a copy of the project on your local machine available to play when desired.

### Prerequisites

This project uses the [p5.js JavaScript library](https://p5js.org/download/) in order to draw and structure the game. In order
to find out more about the library, be sure to visit the p5.js [website](https://p5js.org/).
